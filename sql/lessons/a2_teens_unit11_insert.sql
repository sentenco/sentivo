  "text": "This year's plan is different from my old plans, because it's based on what actually happened before, not just what I hoped would happen. In the past, I used to make big goals in January and give up by February, because they didn't fit my real schedule. This time, my goal is small and steady: twenty minutes of English practice a day, not an hour I know I won't keep. I'm going to check with a friend every month, because I gave up alone last time, but a group project I did around the same time actually finished. If this plan works, it won't be because I tried harder than before. It will be because I built it on evidence, not just hope.",

Realizing that some of my goals used to belong to other people, not really to me, changed how I judged the plan I finally wrote. And comparing what's changed on the outside to what's stayed the same deep down helped me notice that my planning has changed too, not just my goals. I used to plan by wishing.
