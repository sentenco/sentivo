-- Sentivo A1 Kids — Unit 1 CEFR alignment fixes
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor.

-- ============================================================
-- Lesson 1 (Hello & My Name): trim back to name-only.
-- It was asking students to produce age/country ("I am from ___",
-- "I am ___ years old") in Speaking/Reading/Writing/Review, but
-- those were never taught in this lesson's Vocabulary or Phrases
-- slides — age isn't taught until Lesson 2, and country isn't
-- taught anywhere in the unit.
-- ============================================================

-- Slide 6: Speaking — remove the "I am from ___" line
