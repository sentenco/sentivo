-- Sentivo C1 Adults -- Delete old pilot content before rebuild
-- The Adults C1 lesson design changed completely (universal topics,
-- advanced wording, 5-6 slide student flow, single-sheet teacher guide).
-- This removes the only Adults C1 content actually live in Supabase --
-- the original pilot lesson (Unit 1, Lesson 1, "Taking a Quick Position")
-- -- so the rebuild starts clean. Run this whole script in the Supabase
-- SQL editor before running any new C1 Adults insert script.
