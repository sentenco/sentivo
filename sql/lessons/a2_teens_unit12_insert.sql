By Units 9 to 12, I was writing about reasons, choices, and things I used to believe that changed, which I couldn't do convincingly before. The clearest proof isn't a grade. It's that I can now explain an opinion instead of just stating one, and I can connect one idea to another instead of just listing them. The biggest thing I want to keep using isn't a grammar rule at all. It's the habit of asking 'why' and 'compared to what' before I write anything down.",

Planning the class project fairly, based on what failed last time, used the same idea as finding the real reason behind a problem, in the reflection lesson. That idea goes back even further, to Unit 9, where I first learned to compare a bad day to what it taught me, not just describe it. Building a realistic timeline echoed Unit 11's lesson about basing a plan on real experience, not hope. And this final showcase post pulls all of that together into one piece of proof: a comparison between who I was at Unit 1 and who I am now, that I can actually explain with real reasons, not just claim. If I had to name the one skill that ties this whole level together, it would be this: asking why something happened, and what it's proof of, before deciding what to do next.",
