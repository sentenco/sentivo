// A2 Adults digital storybook, Book 10: "Feeling Better Again"
// Static content -- no Supabase, mirrors the pattern in storybookData9.js.
// Like Books 7-9, this book's narrator, Riley, is an adult and stays
// gender-neutral throughout -- no gendered pronoun is ever used for Riley
// in the story, only their name. Grace (the receptionist) and Dr. Santos
// are explicitly "she" in the source; the pharmacist is explicitly "he";
// the nurse is never gendered, so stays neutral.
// Chapter images are not generated yet -- image is left null per chapter so
// StoryBook.jsx's built-in ImagePlaceholder fallback renders instead.

At first, I sit on my bed and hope I will feel better soon. “Maybe it will pass, Riley,” I tell myself, but I do not feel any better. I drink some water, but my throat still hurts, and my body feels weak. Then I decide to visit the small clinic near my apartment. I put on a clean shirt, take my bag, and walk slowly down the street. When I arrive at the clinic, I see a woman sitting behind a desk near the door. She smiles and says, “Good morning, how can I help you?” I tell her, “I have a sore throat, and I do not feel well today.” She gives me a form and asks me to sit down and wait for the doctor.

    story:
      "After a few days of medicine and rest, I wake up and feel much better. My throat does not hurt anymore, and my head feels light and clear. I do not have a fever, and my body feels strong and full of energy. I remember the first morning, when I felt weak, hot, and worried. “Look how far you have come, Riley,” I think, smiling to myself. Now I am thankful for Dr. Santos, the kind nurse, and the friendly pharmacist. I finish all my medicine, exactly as the doctor tells me to. I drink water, eat healthy food, and sleep well every night. I understand now that going to the doctor early is a smart and good choice. Next time I feel sick, I will not be afraid to visit the clinic. As I feel healthy again, I feel happy and thankful because I got the help I needed.",
