// RELAY tracks: each track is a 5-lesson speaking course tailored to one
// context. A track's Library card links to its overview page
// (RelayTrack.jsx), which lists Lessons 1-5; only authored lessons are
// clickable, the rest show as "Coming soon" until their content is added
// here. Mirrors forgeTracks.js, but capped at 5 lessons per track (not 10).
