// RELAY Lesson 1 — "Keep It Going" — Small talk — Baseline diagnostic
//
// RELAY is for learners who give complete, correct, but conversation-ending
// answers — no reason, no detail, no question back, so the exchange dies.
// Every lesson drills one rule: Answer, Add, Ask. No slide ever shows a
// model/"ideal" version of an answer for the student to compare against —
// the student produces every rep themselves, live.
